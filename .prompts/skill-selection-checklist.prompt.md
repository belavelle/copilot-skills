# Skill Selection Checklist

Before using or recommending a Copilot skill, evaluate the task against
the checklist below.

Proceed only if most answers are “yes”.

---

## 1. Repetition
- Is this task likely to be repeated?
- Does it benefit from standardization?

## 2. Specialization
- Does the task require domain-specific knowledge?
- Are there non-obvious rules, constraints, or conventions?

## 3. Workflow
- Does the task involve a multi-step process?
- Would missing a step cause errors or rework?

## 4. Reusability
- Would scripts, templates, or references help?
- Would encoding this once reduce future effort?

## 5. Context Cost
- Is it better to load a focused skill than explain everything inline?
- Can the skill remain concise (<500 lines)?

---

## Decision Rules

- If **most answers are YES** → use or create a skill
- If **most answers are NO** → solve inline, no skill needed
- If uncertain → start without a skill, observe friction, iterate later

Do not use a skill solely because one exists.
